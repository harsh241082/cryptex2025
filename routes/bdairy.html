        <p>Another day, another coffee. I woke up late again, hit snooze

            mornings just feel impossible lately. Dragged myself out of bed,
            made some eggs, scrolled through my phone for way too long. It’s
            like time disappears when I’m staring at a screen.</p>
        <p>
            Work was the usual—emails, meetings, pretending to be more
            interested than I actually was. I don’t hate my job, but it’s
            not exactly thrilling either. I keep telling myself it’s
            temporary, but I’ve been here two years now. Maybe I should
            start looking for something else. Something more... meaningful? Or
            maybe that’s just wishful thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Went to the gym after work, and for once, I actually felt good
            about it. Pushed myself harder than usual, and now my arms feel
            like jelly. But it’s a good kind of sore. A reminder that I did
            something productive today.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dinner was a frozen pizza because cooking for one feels
            pointless sometimes. Watched an episode of a show I’ve seen a
            hundred times already. I should pick up a book instead, but my
            brain’s too fried by the end of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I’m here, writing this, wondering if anything exciting is
            ever going to happen. I keep waiting for some big moment, some
            shift that makes everything fall into place. But maybe that’s
            not how life works. Maybe you have to make things happen instead
            of waiting for them.</p>
        <p>
            Or maybe I just need to get some sleep.</p>
