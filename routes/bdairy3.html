        <p>It’s weird how something so small can stick in your head. It’s
        been a full day since I met that little girl, and I still catch
        myself wondering about her. Not in a weird way—just... curious.</p>
        <p>
            Did she find her brother? Does she always have to be the
            responsible one? Does she even remember me, or was I just some
            random guy she talked to for five minutes before going back to
            her life? I walked by the park again today, half-hoping I’d see
            her. Not that I’d say anything really. But she wasn’t there
            anyway. Just the usual people—joggers, parents, couples walking
            their dogs. It’s funny. I see a hundred people a day and forget
            them the second they pass me.
        </p>
        <p>
        But now I keep thinking about one tiny moment with a kid I’ll
        probably never see again. Maybe it’s because my own life feels
        so repetitive lately, and that moment— her frustration, her
        determination, that little tear that welled up in her eye — it
        all felt real. Or maybe I just need to stop overthinking things.
        It was just a Tuesday, just a park, just a kid in a red coat.
        Still, I can’t help but wonder if she got home okay that night.
        </p>
        <p>I wonder if her brother was alright. I hope they’re alright.</p>
