        <p>Today started off the same as always, barely made it to work on
            time, spent the day wading through emails and meetings. Nothing
            new, nothing exciting. Just another day in the cycle. Except
            something different happened. I was walking back from the
            subway, earbuds in, lost in my own head, when I saw this little
            girl standing alone near the park entrance. She was probably
            seven or eight. She was looking around, eyes wide, clearly
            searching for someone, or something? I took off my earbuds and
            out of curiosity, just walked up to her. I asked if she was
            okay. She looked up at me and said, “I lost my brother.” Her
            voice was small. I looked around. The park wasn’t too crowded,
            Thought I’ll help out an innocent soul. We walked over together,
            and I asked her what he looked like. “He’s wearing a blue
            hoodie. He always runs ahead of me.” She sounded frustrated.</p>
        <p>
            This probably wasn’t the first time her brother had done this.
            Half an hour went by, but we couldn’t get sight of him. She
            finally left home, tears welling in her eyes, assuming that her
            brother must’ve gone back home without her. For some reason I
            felt a pang in my heart. I hope he’s alright. I hope she’s
            alright. To be honest, it just felt like a small moment in an
            otherwise ordinary day. But for some reason, it stuck with me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don’t know why. I don’t know. It felt... different.
